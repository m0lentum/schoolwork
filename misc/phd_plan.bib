	abstract = {We present a theory and applications of discrete exterior calculus on simplicial complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. This can be thought of as calculus on a discrete space. Our theory includes not only discrete differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits both vector fields and forms.},

It can be seen as a generalization of the finite difference time domain ({FDTD}) method. The {DEC} enables efficient time evolution by construction and fits well for non-homogeneous computational domains and obstacles of curved surfaces. These properties are typically present in applications of photonic crystal waveguides that are constructed as periodic structures of inhomogeneities in a computational domain. We present a two-dimensional discrete exterior calculus discretization for photonic crystal waveguides and demonstrate it with a selection of numerical experiments typical in the application area. We also make a numerical comparison of the method with the finite difference time domain method that is a mainstream method for simulating photonic crystal structures. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the discrete exterior calculus method.},

	abstract = {We derive a numerical method for Darcy flow, and also for Poisson’s equation in mixed (first order) form, based on discrete exterior calculus ({DEC}). Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth manifolds and {DEC} is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as triangle and tetrahedral meshes. {DEC} is a coordinate invariant discretization, in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh. We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language of exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential form and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework provided by {DEC} for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on forms. We also develop a discretization for a spatially dependent Hodge star that varies with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address discontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete non-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The resulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type, with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed numerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include patch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known solutions in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability values, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We also show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A convergence experiment is included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short introduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is included in this article. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition in terms of exterior calculus.},

The discrete rotational symmetries of the splitting patterns that emerge in the time evolution are in good agreement with predictions obtained by solving the prevailing dynamical instabilities from the Bogoliubov equations.

In particular, we study the lifetime and decay characteristics of the Alice ring under different experimentally relevant conditions. We observe that, in a 87Rb condensate with a homogeneous external magnetic field, a well-centered Alice ring may survive for over 160 ms, and that during its lifetime it can contract back into a monopole, which again converts into an Alice ring. Interestingly, we notice an additional Alice ring, with an opposite topological charge, to emerge during the decay dynamics within the condensate, leading to the coexistence of two Alice rings in the same cloud. Shortly after this coexistence, the original Alice ring breaks into a line-like defect referred to as an Alice string. We find that the location of the initial isolated monopole correlates with the winding direction of the scalar phase in the produced vortex ring, a phenomenon which we utilize to create two Alice rings with opposite charges and opposite winding directions. Such created Alice ring and anti-Alice ring naturally annihilate each other in the subsequent evolution.},

The harmonic operators are found to improve accuracy signiﬁcantly, while the controllability method is found to be a good choice only in problems with highly nonconvex geometry.

A distinguishing feature of our method is the use of an algebraic discretization of the interior product operator and a combinatorial discretization of the wedge product. The governing equations are first rewritten using the exterior calculus notation, replacing vector calculus differential operators by the exterior derivative, Hodge star and wedge product operators. The discretization is then carried out by substituting with the corresponding discrete operators based on the {DEC} framework. Numerical experiments for flows over surfaces reveal a second order accuracy for the developed scheme when using structured-triangular meshes, and first order accuracy for otherwise unstructured meshes. By construction, the method is conservative in that both mass and vorticity are conserved up to machine precision. The relative error in kinetic energy for inviscid flow test cases converges in a second order fashion with both the mesh size and the time step.},

Plasma consists of collectively behaving charged particles that form the major part of baryonic matter in the Universe. Many concepts ranging from our own planetary environment to the Solar system and beyond can be understood in terms of kinetic plasma physics, represented by the Vlasov equation. We introduce the physical basis for the Vlasov system, and then outline the associated numerical methods that are typically used. A particular application of the Vlasov system is Vlasiator, the world’s first global hybrid-Vlasov simulation for the Earth’s magnetic domain, the magnetosphere. We introduce the design strategies for Vlasiator and outline its numerical concepts ranging from solvers to coupling schemes. We review Vlasiator’s parallelisation methods and introduce the used high-performance computing ({HPC}) techniques. A short review of verification, validation and physical results is included. The purpose of the paper is to present the Vlasov system and introduce an example implementation, and to illustrate that even with massive computational challenges, an accurate description of physics can be rewarding in itself and significantly advance our understanding. Upcoming supercomputing resources are making similar efforts feasible in other fields as well, making our design options relevant for others facing similar challenges.},
