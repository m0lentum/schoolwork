	abstract = {We present a theory and applications of discrete exterior calculus on simplicial complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. This can be thought of as calculus on a discrete space. Our theory includes not only discrete differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits both vector fields and forms.},

	abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Fréchet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fréchet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved.Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.},

Compared to previous {SIGGRAPH} courses, this course focuses heavily on practical aspects of {DEC}, with an emphasis on implementation and applications. The course begins with the core ideas from exterior calculus, in both the smooth and discrete setting. Then it shows how a large number of fundamental geometry-processing tools (smoothing, parameterization, geodesics, mesh optimization, etc.) can be implemented quickly, robustly, and efficiently within this single common framework. It concludes with a discussion of recent extensions of {DEC} that improve efficiency, accuracy, and versatility. The course notes grew out of the discrete differential geometry course taught over the past five years at the California Institute of Technology, for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in computer science, applied mathematics, and associated fields. The notes also provide guided exercises (both written and coding) that attendees can later use to deepen their understanding of the material.},

Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth manifolds and {DEC} is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as triangle and tetrahedral meshes. {DEC} is a coordinate invariant discretization, in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh. We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language of exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential form and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework provided by {DEC} for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on forms. We also develop a discretization for a spatially dependent Hodge star that varies with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address discontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete non-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The resulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type, with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed numerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include patch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known solutions in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability values, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We also show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A convergence experiment is included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short introduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is included in this article. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition in terms of exterior calculus.},

Existing methods suffer from intrinsic artificial dissipation and often apply complicated computational mechanisms to combat such effects. Consequently, dissipative behavior cannot be controlled or modeled explicitly in a manner independent of time step size, complicating the use of coarse previews and adaptive-time stepping methods. This paper proposes simple, unconditionally stable, fully Eulerian integration schemes with no numerical viscosity that are capable of maintaining the liveliness of fluid motion without recourse to corrective devices. Pressure and fluxes are solved efficiently and simultaneously in a time-reversible manner on simplicial grids, and the energy is preserved exactly over long time scales in the case of inviscid fluids. These integrators can be viewed as an extension of the classical energy-preserving Harlow-Welch / Crank-Nicolson scheme to simplicial grids.},

	abstract = {Whitney forms are widely known as finite elements for differential forms. Whitney’s original definition yields first order functions on simplicial complexes, and a lot of research has been devoted to extending the definition to nonsimplicial cells and higher order functions. As a result, the term Whitney forms has become somewhat ambiguous in the literature. Our aim here is to clarify the concept of Whitney forms and explicitly explain their key properties. We discuss Whitney’s initial definition with more depth than usually, giving three equivalent ways to define Whitney forms. We give a comprehensive exposition of their main properties, including the proofs. Understanding of these properties is important as they can be taken as a guideline on how to extend Whitney forms to nonsimplicial cells or higher order functions. We discuss several generalisations of Whitney forms and check which of the properties can be preserved.},

First, the notion of a general field is introduced as a formal sum of differential forms on a Minkowski manifold. By the action principle the conservation law is defined for such a general field. By construction, particular field notions of physics, e.g., magnetic flux, electric field strength, stress, strain etc. become instances of the general field. Hence, the differential equations that constitute physical field theories become also instances of the general conservation law. The general field and the general conservation law together correspond to a large class of relativistic hyperbolic physical field models. The parabolic and elliptic models can thereafter be derived by adding constraints. The approach creates solid foundations for developing software systems for scientific computing; the unifying structure shared by the class of field models makes it possible to implement software systems which are not restricted to certain predefined problems. The versatility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with moving and deforming domains.},

Compared to previous work, where the controllability problem takes place in a subspace of H1(Ω)×L2(Ω), we can compute the periodic solutions by solving the novel controllability problem by a conjugate gradient algorithm operating in (L2(Ω))d+1. The finite dimensional realization of the above algorithm does not require special preconditioning (as it is the case when the control space is contained in H1(Ω)×L2(Ω), requiring then the solution of discrete elliptic problems to achieve preconditioning).

Résumé
Dans cette Note, on étudie une méthode, basée sur la contrôlabilité exacte, pour le calcul des solutions périodiques en temps d'une équation des ondes scalaire à coefficients constants. On y prend avantage d'une formulation mixte équivalente du problème d'ondes pour se rammener à un problème de contrôlabilité posé dans (L2(Ω))d+1 (on suppose que Ω⊂Rd). Comparé à des travaux précédents, où le problème de contrôlabilité est posé dans un sous-espace de H1(Ω)×L2(Ω), on peut calculer les solutions périodiques en résolvant le nouveau problème de contrôlabilité par un algorithme de gradient conjugué opérant dans (L2(Ω))d+1. L' analogue discret de l'algorithme ci-dessus ne demande pas de préconditionnement sophistiqué (comme c'est le cas quand l'espace de contrôle est contenu dans H1(Ω)×L2(Ω), exigeant alors la résolution de problèmes elliptiques discrets pour préconditionner). Les résultats d'essais numériques validant la nouvelle approche feront l'objet d'une note ultérieure. Pour citer cet article : R. Glowinski, T. Rossi, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. I 343 (2006).},

kehitetään kattamaan korkeamman asteen approksimaatioita. Keskeisintä on
verkon muodostaminen korkeamman asteen interpolointiin soveltuvalla tavalla.
Tätä varten esitetään systemaattinen strategia simplekseillä ja hyperkuutioilla.
Solut jaetaan pienempiin soluihin, joita voidaan käyttää interpolanttien ja näiden
vapausasteiden määrittelemiseen. Kun verkko sisältää nämä pienemmät solut,

@book{whitney_geometric_1957,
	title = {Geometric Integration Theory},
	abstract = {Geared toward upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, this treatment of geometric integration theory consists of three parts: an introduction to classical theory, a postulational approach to general theory, and a final section that continues the general study with Lebesgue theory.The introductory chapter shows how the simplest hypotheses lead to the employment of basic tools. The opening third of the treatment, an examination of classical theory, leads to the theory of the Riemann integral and includes a study of smooth (i.e., differentiable) manifolds. The second part, on general theory, explores abstract integration theory, some relations between chains and functions, general properties of chains and cochains, and chains and cochains in open sets. The third and final section surveys Lebesgue theory in terms of flat cochains and differential forms, Lipschitz mappings, and chains and additive set functions. Appendixes on vector and linear spaces, geometric and topological preliminaries, and analytical preliminaries, along with indexes of symbols and terms, conclude the text.},

We formulate the problem as an exact controllability one and solve the wave equation in time-domain. In a mixed formulation we look for solutions u = (v, p)T. The use of mixed formulation allows us to set the related controllability problem in (L2(Ω))d+1, a space of square-integrable functions in dimension d + 1. No preconditioning is needed when solving this with conjugate gradient method. We present numerical results concerning performance and convergence properties of the method.},

The typical procedure for solving the time-harmonic elastic wave equation leads to difficulties solving large-scale indefinite linear systems. To avoid these difficulties, we consider the original time dependent equation with a method based on an exact controllability formulation. The main idea of this approach is to find initial conditions such that after one time-period, the solution and its time derivative coincide with the initial conditions.The wave equation is discretized in the space domain with spectral elements. The degrees of freedom associated with the basis functions are situated at the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature points of the elements, and the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rule is used so that the mass matrix becomes diagonal. This method is combined with the second-order central finite difference or the fourth-order Runge–Kutta time discretization. As a consequence of these choices, only matrix–vector products are needed in time dependent simulation. This makes the controllability method computationally efficient.},

Previous work most commonly employs barycentric or circumcentric duals; while barycentric duals guarantee that the dual of each simplex lies within the simplex, circumcentric duals are often preferred due to the induced orthogonality between primal and dual complexes. We instead promote the use of weighted duals ("power diagrams"). They allow greater flexibility in the location of dual vertices while keeping primal-dual orthogonality, thus providing a valuable extension to the usual choices of dual by only adding one additional scalar per primal vertex. Furthermore, we introduce a family of functionals on pairs of complexes that we derive from bounds on the errors induced by diagonal Hodge stars, commonly used in discrete computations. The minimizers of these functionals, called {HOT} meshes, are shown to be generalizations of Centroidal Voronoi Tesselations and Optimal Delaunay Triangulations, and to provide increased accuracy and flexibility for a variety of computational purposes.},

We provide a common framework for mimetic discretizations using algebraic topology to guide our analysis. The framework and all attendant discrete structures are put together by using two basic mappings between differential forms and cochains. The key concept of the framework is a natural inner product on cochains which induces a combinatorial Hodge theory on the cochain complex. The framework supports mutually consistent operations of differentiation and integration, has a combinatorial Stokes theorem, and preserves the invariants of the De Rham cohomology groups. This allows, among other things, for an elementary calculation of the kernel of the discrete Laplacian. Our framework provides an abstraction that includes examples of compatible finite element, finite volume, and finite difference methods. We describe how these methods result from a choice of the reconstruction operator and explain when they are equivalent. We demonstrate how to apply the framework for compatible discretization for two scalar versions of the Hodge Laplacian.},

	abstract = {We use first-principles-derived numerical simulations to investigate the long-time evolution of a half-quantum vortex ring, an Alice ring, arising from the decay dynamics of an isolated monopole in the polar phase of a dilute spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, we study the lifetime and decay characteristics of the Alice ring under different experimentally relevant conditions. We observe that, in a 87Rb condensate with a homogeneous external magnetic field, a well-centered Alice ring may survive for over 160 ms, and that during its lifetime it can contract back into a monopole, which again converts into an Alice ring. Interestingly, we notice an additional Alice ring, with an opposite topological charge, to emerge during the decay dynamics within the condensate, leading to the coexistence of two Alice rings in the same cloud. Shortly after this coexistence, the original Alice ring breaks into a line-like defect referred to as an Alice string. We find that the location of the initial isolated monopole correlates with the winding direction of the scalar phase in the produced vortex ring, a phenomenon which we utilize to create two Alice rings with opposite charges and opposite winding directions. Such created Alice ring and anti-Alice ring naturally annihilate each other in the subsequent evolution.},

In this paper, full-wave {CE}-{FDTD} formulations, and a comprehensive analysis of the numerical stability and dispersion of this method are presented. It is found that that the maximum time step allowed for stability is strongly dependent upon the ratio of the carrier wavelength to spatial step sizes. When this ratio is larger than a threshold value, the time step is bounded by a Courant-Frederick-Levy ({CFL}) condition. When this ratio is lower than the threshold value, the time step is no longer bounded by this stability condition. However, in such instances, the associated numerical dispersion errors become unacceptably large (more than 200\%). Therefore, in comparison with the conventional {FDTD} method, the {CE}-{FDTD} method is proven to be not advantageous in terms of computation efficiency for an accuracy of a similar level.},
