	abstract = {A general conservation law that deﬁnes a class of physics ﬁeld theories is constructed. First, the notion of a general ﬁeld is introduced as a formal sum diﬀerential forms on a Minkowski manifold. By the action principle the conservation law is deﬁned for such a general ﬁeld. By construction, particular ﬁeld notions of physics, e.g., magnetic ﬂux, electric ﬁeld strength, stress, strain etc. become instances of the general ﬁeld. Hence, the diﬀerential equations that constitute physics ﬁeld theories become also instances of the general conservation law. The general ﬁeld and the general conservation law together correspond to a large class of relativistic hyperbolic physics ﬁeld models. The parabolic and elliptic models can thereafter be derived by adding constraints. The approach creates solid foundations for developing software systems for scientiﬁc computing; the unifying structure shared by the class of ﬁeld models makes it possible to implement software systems which are not restricted to certain predeﬁned problems. The versatility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with moving and deforming domains.},

Our theory includes not only discrete differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits both vector fields and forms.},

The solution method precisely follows the conservation laws in ﬁnite-dimensional systems, whereas the constitutive relations are imposed approximately. We employ discrete exterior calculus for the spatial discretization, use natural crystal structures for three-dimensional meshing, and derive a “discrete Hodge” adapted to harmonic wave. The numerical experiments indicate that the cumulative pollution error can be practically eliminated in the case of harmonic wave problems. The restrictions following from the {CFL} condition can be bypassed with a local time-stepping scheme. The computational savings are at least one order of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Fréchet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fréchet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved.Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.},

Compared to previous {SIGGRAPH} courses, this course focuses heavily on practical aspects of {DEC}, with an emphasis on implementation and applications. The course begins with the core ideas from exterior calculus, in both the smooth and discrete setting. Then it shows how a large number of fundamental geometry-processing tools (smoothing, parameterization, geodesics, mesh optimization, etc.) can be implemented quickly, robustly, and efficiently within this single common framework. It concludes with a discussion of recent extensions of {DEC} that improve efficiency, accuracy, and versatility. The course notes grew out of the discrete differential geometry course taught over the past five years at the California Institute of Technology, for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in computer science, applied mathematics, and associated fields. The notes also provide guided exercises (both written and coding) that attendees can later use to deepen their understanding of the material.},

These properties are typically present in applications of photonic crystal waveguides that are constructed as periodic structures of inhomogeneities in a computational domain. We present a two-dimensional discrete exterior calculus discretization for photonic crystal waveguides and demonstrate it with a selection of numerical experiments typical in the application area.

	abstract = {We derive a numerical method for Darcy flow, and also for Poisson’s equation in mixed (first order) form, based on discrete exterior calculus ({DEC}). Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth manifolds and {DEC} is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as triangle and tetrahedral meshes. {DEC} is a coordinate invariant discretization, in that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh. We start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language of exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential form and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework provided by {DEC} for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on forms. We also develop a discretization for a spatially dependent Hodge star that varies with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address discontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete non-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The resulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type, with a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed numerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include patch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known solutions in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability values, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We also show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A convergence experiment is included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short introduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is included in this article. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition in terms of exterior calculus.},

	abstract = {Numerical viscosity has long been a problem in fluid animation. Existing methods suffer from intrinsic artificial dissipation and often apply complicated computational mechanisms to combat such effects. Consequently, dissipative behavior cannot be controlled or modeled explicitly in a manner independent of time step size, complicating the use of coarse previews and adaptive-time stepping methods. This paper proposes simple, unconditionally stable, fully Eulerian integration schemes with no numerical viscosity that are capable of maintaining the liveliness of fluid motion without recourse to corrective devices. Pressure and fluxes are solved efficiently and simultaneously in a time-reversible manner on simplicial grids, and the energy is preserved exactly over long time scales in the case of inviscid fluids. These integrators can be viewed as an extension of the classical energy-preserving Harlow-Welch / Crank-Nicolson scheme to simplicial grids.},

	abstract = {Whitney forms are widely known as finite elements for differential forms. Whitney’s original definition yields first order functions on simplicial complexes, and a lot of research has been devoted to extending the definition to nonsimplicial cells and higher order functions. As a result, the term Whitney forms has become somewhat ambiguous in the literature. Our aim here is to clarify the concept of Whitney forms and explicitly explain their key properties. We discuss Whitney’s initial definition with more depth than usually, giving three equivalent ways to define Whitney forms. We give a comprehensive exposition of their main properties, including the proofs. Understanding of these properties is important as they can be taken as a guideline on how to extend Whitney forms to nonsimplicial cells or higher order functions. We discuss several generalisations of Whitney forms and check which of the properties can be preserved.},

The problem is presented in terms of differential forms, and the discrete exterior calculus is utilized for the spatial discretization. Accordingly, the physical properties of the problem are maintained. Despite we consider time-harmonic problems, we concentrate on transient wave equations treated by the exact controllability approach. Essentially, we use a controlled variation of the asymptotic approach with periodic constraints, in which the time-dependent equation is simulated in time, until the time-harmonic solution is reached.},
