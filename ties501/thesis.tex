\chapter{Introduction}



\chapter{Model}

The phenomenon we wish to simulate is the scattering
of acoustic waves by a sound-soft obstacle (TODO: what does sound-soft mean).
We consider acoustic waves described by the differential equation

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2\phi = 0
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is a velocity potential and $c$ is the speed of wave propagation.
This equation is equivalent to the first-order system

\begin{equation}\label{wave1stOrd}
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} - \nabla p = 0 \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $p = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ is acoustic pressure
and $\mathbf{v} = \nabla \phi$ is the velocity
of particles perturbed by the wave.

The system \eqref{wave1stOrd} applies within the spatial domain $\Omega$
and the time domain $[0, T]$.
We model the scattering obstacle by excluding its interior from $\Omega$
and applying an incoming wave $\phi_{inc}$ on its boundary $\Gamma_{sca}$
as a Dirichlet boundary condition

\[
  \begin{cases}
    p = \frac{\partial \phi_{inc}}{\partial t} \\
    \mathbf{v} = \nabla \phi_{inc} \\
  \end{cases}
  \quad \text{in } \Gamma_{sca} \times [0, T].
\]

On the outer boundary of the domain $\Gamma_{ext}$
we model the uninterrupted propagation of waves past the boundary
with a first-order absorbing Engqvist-Majda boundary condition
\parencite{engquist_absorbing_1977}

\[
  \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla\phi = 0
  \quad \text{in } \Gamma_{ext} \times [0, T].
\]


TODO: maybe the boundary conditions would be better explained
in the experiments chapter?
Possibly remove this chapter altogether,
mention scattering in the introduction
and list where each part of the model is explained
(wave equation in DEC, boundary conditions to model scattering in experiments)



\chapter{Discrete Exterior Calculus}

The Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC),
originally developed by Desbrun et al. \parencite*{desbrun_discrete_2005},
is a discretization method for differential equations
based on the exterior calculus of differential forms.
This chapter gives a brief introduction to the mathematical concepts
underlying the method, followed by a description of the DEC itself
and a DEC discretization of our acoustics equations.
The reader is assumed to be familiar with linear algebra and vector calculus.

\section{Differential forms and the continuous exterior calculus}

This section is meant as a somewhat informal and intuitive introduction
to differential forms, summarizing relevant sections of
(\cite{blair_perot_differential_2014}) and (\cite{crane_digital_2013}).
For a more formal and comprehensive approach to the topic,
see a textbook on differential geometry such as (\cite{lee_introduction_2012})
or (\cite{abraham_manifolds_2012}).

Differential forms are in many ways analogous to vectors.
To illustrate the similarities and differences,
consider the dot product operation
for two vectors in linear algebra.
Expressed in matrix form, the dot product between vectors
$\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_n)^T$ and $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, \dots, b_n)^T$
is

\[
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}
  = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_1 & \dots & a_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n
  \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The dot product measures the length of $\mathbf{b}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{a}$,
and to do this, $\mathbf{a}$ is transposed into a \textit{row vector}.
This row vector can be thought of as a function
that takes a vector and measures it along $\mathbf{a}$,

\[
  \alpha(\mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}.
\]

In the language of differential forms,
a function like this is called a \textit{1-form},
because it takes a single vector as its parameter
and computes its length along one dimension.
We can also measure higher-dimensional quantities.
A 2-form is a two-dimensional object that takes two vectors,
which define a parallelogram in a plane,
and computes the area of this parallelogram
projected onto the 2-form.
Similarly, 3-forms measure the volumes of parallelepipeds
defined by three vectors, and so on for higher dimensions.
Additionally, we can define 0-forms
as objects that take zero inputs and return a measurement,
making them equivalent to scalar fields.

% - basis vectors dx, dy (, dz? is it easier to explain in 3d?)
% - wedge product
% - integration
% - differentiation
% - Hodge star
% - why this is useful: coordinate-free formulas (simplicity/concisenes),
%   curved space, higher dimensional space

\section{Computation mesh}

% - triangle mesh
% - dual mesh, 1:1 correspondence, circumcentric, barycentric
% - mesh as simplicial complex
% - chains and cochains

\section{Whitney forms}



\chapter{Exact controllability}

% - most of this chapter should be copyable from notes too

\section{Objective}

\section{Challenges}

% - mesh quality matters a lot, stability can be a challenge
% - future work: Hodge optimized dual
