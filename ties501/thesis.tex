\chapter{Model}

The phenomenon we wish to simulate is the scattering
of acoustic waves by a sound-soft obstacle (TODO: what does sound-soft mean).
We consider acoustic waves described by the differential equation

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2\phi = 0
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is a velocity potential and $c$ is the speed of wave propagation.
This equation is equivalent to the first-order system

\begin{equation}\label{wave1stOrd}
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} - c^2\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} - \nabla p = 0 \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $p = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}$ is acoustic pressure
and $\mathbf{v} = \nabla \phi$ is the velocity
of particles perturbed by the wave.

The system \eqref{wave1stOrd} applies within the spatial domain $\Omega$
and the time domain $[0, T]$.
We model the scattering obstacle by excluding its interior from $\Omega$
and applying an incoming wave $\phi_{inc}$ on its boundary $\Gamma_{sca}$
as a Dirichlet boundary condition

\[
  \begin{cases}
    p = \frac{\partial \phi_{inc}}{\partial t} \\
    \mathbf{v} = \nabla \phi_{inc} \\
  \end{cases}
  \quad \text{in } \Gamma_{sca} \times [0, T].
\]

On the outer boundary of the domain $\Gamma_{ext}$
we model the uninterrupted propagation of waves past the boundary
with a first-order absorbing Engqvist-Majda boundary condition
\parencite{engquist_absorbing_1977}

\[
  \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{n} \cdot \nabla\phi = 0
  \quad \text{in } \Gamma_{ext} \times [0, T].
\]


TODO: maybe the boundary conditions would be better explained
in the experiments chapter?
Possibly remove this chapter altogether
and explain the model in parts elsewhere



\chapter{Discrete Exterior Calculus}

Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC),
originally developed by Desbrun et al. \parencite*{desbrun_discrete_2005},
is a discretization method for differential equations
based on the exterior calculus of differential forms.
This chapter gives a brief introduction to the mathematical concepts
underlying the method, followed by a description of the DEC itself
and a DEC discretization of our acoustics equations.
The reader is assumed to be familiar with linear algebra and vector calculus.


\section{Differential forms and the continuous exterior calculus}

This section is meant as a somewhat informal and intuitive introduction
to differential forms, summarizing relevant sections of
\parencite{blair_perot_differential_2014} and \parencite{crane_digital_2013}.
For a more formal and comprehensive approach to the topic,
see a textbook on differential geometry such as \parencite{lee_introduction_2012}
or \parencite{abraham_manifolds_2012}.


\subsection{Differential forms}

Notationally, a differential form looks like an \textit{integrand},
e.g. the $dx$ in $\int dx$ or the $5\,dx\,dy$ in $\iint 5\,dx\,dy$.
Indeed, the things we integrate are all technically differential forms.
However, this seems rather abstract.
Are these objects meaningful outside of integration,
and if so, what do they do?
This section looks at differential forms as functions,
taking inspiration from \parencite{crane_digital_2013}.

Differential forms are in many ways analogous to vectors.
To illustrate the similarities and differences,
consider the dot product operation
for two vectors in linear algebra.
Expressed in matrix form, the dot product between vectors
$\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_n)^T$ and $\mathbf{b} = (b_1, \dots, b_n)^T$
is

\[
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}
  = \begin{bmatrix}
    a_1 & \dots & a_n
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n
  \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The dot product measures the length of $\mathbf{b}$ in the direction of $\mathbf{a}$,
and to do this, $\mathbf{a}$ is transposed into a \textit{row vector}.
This row vector can be thought of as a function
that takes a vector and measures it along $\mathbf{a}$,

\[
  \alpha(\mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{b}.
\]

In the language of differential forms,
a function like this is called a \textit{1-form},
because it takes a single vector as its parameter
and computes its length along one dimension.

We can also measure higher-dimensional quantities.
A 2-form is a function that takes two vectors,
which define a parallelogram,
and computes the area of this parallelogram
when projected onto a plane.
Similarly, 3-forms measure the volumes of parallelepipeds
defined by three vectors, and so on for higher dimensions.
Additionally, we can define 0-forms
as objects that take zero vectors as input and return a measurement,
making them equivalent to scalar fields.

For forms of dimension 2 and above, we also need to consider
the notion of \textit{signed} areas and volumes.
Much like how the vector cross product flips its direction
depending on whether its arguments come in clockwise or counterclockwise order,
a differential form's output will change its sign
if any two of its arguments are exchanged.
The sign is a measurement of the given volume's \textit{orientation}:
clockwise or counterclockwise for 2D areas,
right-handed or left-handed basis for 3D volumes, etc.
This is why differential forms are formally defined as \textit{antisymmetric tensors}
-- they're multilinear functions on vectors (i.e. tensors)
which change sign when arguments are exchanged (i.e. they are antisymmetric).

\subsection{Proxy vectors}

There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between row and column vectors,
expressed in the transpose operator.
An analogous one-to-one correspondence also exists between 1-forms and vectors.
The operators realizing this correspondence are called
\textit{sharp} $\sharp$ and \textit{flat} $\flat$.
Sharp turns a 1-form into the corresponding vector,
and flat does the reverse.
In other words, given a 1-form $\alpha$,
$v = \alpha^{\sharp}$ is a vector and $v^{\flat} = \alpha$.

We call $v$ a \textit{vector proxy} of $\alpha$.
When performing exterior calculus computations,
the inputs and results are typically interpreted
and visualized as their vector proxies.

TODO: this would be a good spot to explain Einstein notation if I use it

\subsection{Basis forms}

Like vectors, differential forms also form a vector space,
meaning they can be expressed as linear combinations of basis vectors.
In $\mathbb{R}^3$, with axes labeled $x$, $y$, and $z$,
the corresponding basis 1-forms are called $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$.

Higher-dimensional forms also have this vector space structure,
but defining a basis for them is not quite as straightforward.
The issue is that $n$-forms measure $n$-dimensional geometric objects
which require $n$ different vectors to define.
Thus, to define an $n$-form we need a formal way to combine
measurements in $n$ different directions.
The operator which does this is called the \textit{exterior product}.

\subsection{Exterior product}

You may recall from linear algebra that the signed area of a parallelogram
defined by two vectors $u,v$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is computed
by the cross product $u \times v$.
Similarly, the volume of a parallelepiped defined by three vectors $u,v,w$
is computed by the triple product $(u \times v) \cdot w$,
and in general the volume spanned by $n$ vectors $v_1, \dots, v_n$
is the determinant
\[
  \det \begin{bmatrix}
    v_1, \dots, v_n
  \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The analogous operation for differential forms is called the
\textit{exterior product} or \textit{wedge product} $\wedge$,
which takes a $k$-form $\alpha$ and a $j$-form $\beta$
and produces a $(k+j)$-form which measures volumes spanned by
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ combined.
For instance, if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both 1-forms,
$\alpha \wedge \beta$ is a 2-form which measures parallelograms
in the plane spanned by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Depending on the dimension of forms being multiplied,
the wedge product's sign may change
when the order of its arguments is flipped. Specifically,
\[
  \alpha \wedge \beta = (-1)^{kj} \beta \wedge \alpha.
\]
Additionally, the wedge product is associative, meaning
\[
  (\alpha \wedge \beta) \wedge \gamma = \alpha \wedge (\beta \wedge \gamma).
\]

These three properties (addition of dimensions, antisymmetry, and associativity)
are enough to define the wedge product abstractly in all dimensions.
In practice, what this operation looks like depends on the dimension of its operands
in a way that mirrors the vector operations measuring volumes.
The wedge product of two 1-forms in 3D space
is equivalent to the cross product on the vector proxies of the forms,
and the wedge product of three 1-forms (really a 2-form and a 1-form)
is equivalent to the triple product on the vector proxies.
Additionally, since a 0-form is just a scalar,
the wedge product of a 0-form with anything is a scalar multiplication.

To give a specific example, consider two vectors $u,v$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$
and two 1-forms $\alpha, \beta$. The wedge product
\[
  \alpha \wedge \beta (u,v) = \alpha(u)\beta(v) - \alpha(v)\beta(u),
\]
is equivalent to $\star(\alpha^{\sharp} \times \beta^{\sharp})^{\flat}$.
The star symbol in this expression is the \textit{Hodge star},
which will be covered in section \ref{sec:hodge}.

The 1-form wedge product can be visualized as combining two vectors
into a single oriented parallelogram,
or in a sense, two basis elements of a line
into a basis element of a plane.
Similarly, further wedge products add on more basis elements,
producing higher-dimensional oriented volumes.
This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:wedge}.

    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Exterior products of 1-forms visualized as volumes.}
  \label{fig:wedge}
\end{figure}

Thinking about an $n$-form as an oriented piece
of an $n$-dimensional subspace like this is an intuition
which will be useful in understanding the operations of exterior calculus.

A consequence of the wedge product being defined to measure volumes
is that the wedge product of a form with itself is always zero;
$\alpha \wedge \alpha = 0$ for all $\alpha$.
This is because, intuitively, two parallel vectors
form a parallelogram with zero area,
and in general a linearly dependent set of vectors
forms a degenerate volume.

Naturally, the dimension of a form cannot exceed that of the space it's embedded in.
Thus, the wedge product in $n$-dimensional space
is only defined for operands whose dimensions sum to $n$ or less.

Equipped with the exterior product,
we can define a basis for higher-dimensional forms.

\subsection{Higher-dimensional basis forms}\label{sec:basis_higher}

Basis forms of dimension 2 and above
are defined in terms of basis 1-forms and the exterior product.

In three dimensions, there are obviously three basis 1-forms.
The basis of 2-forms also has three elements,
or in other words, there are three linearly independent basis planes.
This number can be deduced algebraically
by taking the wedge product of all possible pairs of basis 1-forms
and eliminating ones that are either zero or a multiple of another.
A more intuitive geometric reasoning is that 
a plane in three dimensions is uniquely identified by its normal vector;
therefore the space of all planes has the same dimension as the space of all vectors.

There is only one three-dimensional subspace of three-dimensional space,
and thus only one basis 3-form.
This is true for any $n$:
there is only one basis $n$-form in $n$-dimensional space.
This form is called the \textit{volume form} of the space,
and it behaves like a scalar in computations.
Table \ref{tab:basis_3d} lists the basis forms in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{c | l}
    $n$ & basis $n$-forms \\
    \hline
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & $dx$,\, $dy$,\, $dz$ \\
    2 & $dx \wedge dy$,\, $dy \wedge dz$,\, $dz \wedge dx$ \\
    3 & $dx \wedge dy \wedge dz$ \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Basis forms in $\mathbb{R}^3$.}
  \label{tab:basis_3d}
\end{table}

In two dimensions things are somewhat simpler,
as there is only one plane, and the 2-form is the volume form.
Table \ref{tab:basis_2d} lists the basis forms in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{c | l}
    $n$ & basis $n$-forms \\
    \hline
    0 & 1 \\
    1 & $dx$,\, $dy$ \\
    2 & $dx \wedge dy$ \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Basis forms in $\mathbb{R}^2$.}
  \label{tab:basis_2d}
\end{table}

\subsection{Hodge star}\label{sec:hodge}

Consider the idea mentioned in section \ref{sec:basis_higher}
that a plane in three dimensions is uniquely identified by its normal vector.
This is one manifestation of the general fact that a linear subspace
is uniquely identified by its orthogonal complement.
In the context of differential forms,
an analogous statement is that there is an equal number
of basis $k$-forms and $(n-k)$-forms in $n$-dimensional space
and the map from a $k$-form to its orthogonal $(n-k)$-form
is an isomorphism.

The isomorphism taking a $k$-form to the orthogonal $(n-k)$-form
with the same magnitude is an important operator
called the \textit{Hodge star} $\star$.
It is a linear operator whose effect on the $\mathbb{R}^3$ basis forms
is as follows:

\begin{align*}
  \star 1 &= dx \wedge dy \wedge dz \\
  \star dx &= dy \wedge dz \\
  \star dy &= dz \wedge dx \\
  \star dz &= dx \wedge dy \\
  \star (dx \wedge dy) &= dz \\
  \star (dy \wedge dz) &= dx \\
  \star (dz \wedge dx) &= dy \\
  \star (dx \wedge dy \wedge dz) &= 1 \\
\end{align*}

Applying the star twice amounts to doing nothing at all,
$\star\star\alpha = \alpha$.

In $\mathbb{R}^2$ this is complicated slightly by the fact that
the orthogonal complement of a line is also a line,
and the Hodge star on 1-forms amounts to a 90 degree rotation.
Hence, for 1-forms in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a star twice is a 180 degree rotation,
$\star\star\alpha = -\alpha$.
In general, for $k$-forms in $n$-dimensional space,
\[
  \star\star\alpha = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\alpha.
\]

The effect of the Hodge star on the $\mathbb{R}^2$ basis forms is
\begin{align*}
  \star 1 &= dx \wedge dy \\
  \star dx &= dy \\
  \star dy &= -dx \\
  \star (dx \wedge dy) &= 1 \\
\end{align*}

TODO: Something about how
the Hodge star depends on the metric?
Something about the inner product?
These things aren't really relevant to the current use case,
but might be interesting

\subsection{Exterior derivative}\label{sec:ext_der}

The final operations we need to define the \textit{calculus} part of exterior calculus
are differentiation and integration.
Integration is exactly the procedure familiar from multivariate calculus
(differential forms are integrands, after all).
1-forms can be integrated over curves, 2-forms over surfaces,
3-forms over volumes, and so on.
Differentiation is performed by the \textit{exterior derivative} $\mathbf{d}$,
which, like the exterior product,
is equivalent to several different vector operators
depending on the dimension of its operand.

A common property of the exterior derivative regardless of dimension
is that it increases the dimension of its operand by one.
In other words, the exterior derivative of a $k$-form is a $(k+1)-form$.
This, along with the \textit{product rule}
\[
  \mathbf{d}(\alpha \wedge \beta)
  = \mathbf{d}\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^k \beta \wedge \mathbf{d}\alpha,
\]
the property $\mathbf{d} \circ \mathbf{d} = 0$,
and the definition of $\mathbf{d}$ for 0-forms,
can be used to recursively define the exterior derivative for all dimensions,
but as with the wedge product, the formal definition is very abstract.
An intuitive explanation of why $\mathbf{d}$ is defined this way
is outside the scope of this thesis,
but a reasoning based on the \textit{differential of a manifold}
is given in \cite{crane_digital_2013}.
For our purposes it will suffice to cover the equivalent vector proxy operations
for each dimension of $\mathbf{d}$.

A 0-form $f$ is a scalar function.
Its exterior derivative is the gradient, also known as the differential,
\[
  \mathbf{d}f = \nabla f = df.
\]
Omitting conversions with $\sharp$, $\flat$ and $\star$ for clarity,
the exterior derivative of a 1-form $\alpha$ corresponds to the
\textit{curl} of the vector proxy,
\[
  \mathbf{d}\alpha \eqsim \nabla \times \alpha.
\]
The exterior derivative of the volume form is not defined
(as it would produce a form of higher dimension than the space),
so in two dimensions this is the final $\mathbf{d}$.
In three dimensions, the exterior derivative of a 2-form $\beta$
is the \textit{divergence} of the (perpendicular) vector proxy,
\[
  \mathbf{d}\beta \eqsim \nabla \cdot \beta.
\]

These relationships give rise to \textit{Stokes' theorem},
which states that for a $k$-dimensional domain $\Omega$
with boundary $\partial \Omega$ and a $(k-1)$-form $\alpha$,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stokes_theorem}
  \int_{\Omega} \mathbf{d}\alpha = \int_{\partial\Omega} \alpha.
\end{equation}

This theorem encapsulates several vector calculus identities
such as Green's theorem and the divergence theorem.
It is crucial in defining the discrete exterior calculus
and will be covered in more detail in section \ref{sec:disc_ext_der}.

More possible differential forms TODOs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item why this is useful: coordinate-free formulas (simplicity/conciseness),
    curved space, higher dimensional space
  \item manifolds?
  \item acoustics equations expressed with differential forms?
    or maybe that should go in section \ref{sec:dec_model}
\end{itemize}


\section{Computation mesh}

The discrete spatial structure at the root of the DEC is the \textit{simplicial complex}:
essentially a mesh (in the computer graphics sense)
consisting of triangles in two dimensions,
tetrahedra in three dimensions, or \textit{$k$-simplices} in $k$ dimensions.
We will focus on the two-dimensional case here for illustration.
This section is based on \parencite{desbrun_discrete_2006}.


\subsection{Simplices}

A \textit{$k$-simplex} is the simplest type of $k$-dimensional element
in a polyhedral mesh, defined as
the convex hull of $k + 1$ geometrically distinct points.
In concrete terms, a 0-simplex is a single point,
a 1-simplex is a line segment, a 2-simplex is a triangle,
a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, and so on.
In the context of a mesh, a 0-simplex is often called a \textit{vertex},
a 1-simplex an \textit{edge}, a 2-simplex a \textit{face},
and a $k$-simplex where $k > 2$ a \textit{volume} or \textit{$k$-volume}.

Every simplex with dimension $k > 0$
has a \textit{boundary} consisting of $(k-1)$-simplices.
For instance, every triangle (2-simplex) is bounded by three line segments (1-simplices),
and every line segment is bounded by two vertices.
Each $(k-1)$-simplex on the boundary of a $k$-simplex $\sigma_k$
is called a \textit{$(k-1)$-face} of $\sigma_k$.

We denote simplices by listing their vertices, e.g. a triangle
$\sigma_2 = \{v_0, v_1, v_2\}$.


\subsection{Simplicial complex}

A simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is a set of simplices satisfying the rules

\begin{itemize}
  \item every face of every simplex in $\mathcal{K}$ is also in $\mathcal{K}$
  \item any two simplices in $\mathcal{K}$ either do not intersect at all
    or share an entire face.
\end{itemize}

In the case of a 2D triangle mesh, this means
that every edge and vertex of every triangle is also part of the complex,
and there are no overlapping triangles
or edges/vertices that aren't part of a triangle's boundary.

A similar complex could be defined without requiring
all its elements to be simplicial.
For instance, a rectilinear grid is a common such structure.
A complex like this is called a \textit{cell complex}
and its $k$-dimensional elements \textit{$k$-cells}.
A simplex is a special case of a cell,
and the concepts of boundary and face apply to all cells.
We will use a simplicial complex in this thesis,
however, non-simplicial cells become relevant in the \textit{dual mesh}
(section \ref{sec:dual_mesh}).


\subsection{Orientation of a simplex}

Much like how differential forms of dimension 2 and higher
have a notion of two distinct orientations,
which manifest themselves in the sign of measured volumes,
simplices with 2 or more vertices also have two possible orientations
depending on the order of the vertices.
For a line segment there are two possible ways to order its two vertices,
for a triangle there are three clockwise and three counterclockwise orderings,
and so on.

As part of the definition of our simplicial complex,
each simplex receives an orientation.
For reasons that will become clear when
we define the discrete exterior derivative in section \ref{sec:disc_ext_der},
every simplex also needs its boundary to match its orientation.
For a counterclockwise oriented triangle, for instance,
this means the boundary line segments must form
a counterclockwise circulation around the triangle.
Since a line segment is often part of two triangles with conflicting orientations,
the defined orientations cannot be consistent with every boundary.

To resolve inconsistent face orientations,
the \textit{boundary operator} $\partial$,
which takes a simplex and returns its faces,
must flip every face that doesn't match the desired orientation.
This is denoted as a multiplication by -1.
For example, the boundary of a counterclockwise oriented triangle $\{v_0, v_1, v_2\}$
with edges $\{v_0, v_1\}$, $\{v_1, v_2\}$, $\{v_0, v_2\}$ is
\[
  \partial \{v_0, v_1, v_2\} = \{v_0, v_1\} + \{v_1, v_2\} - \{v_0, v_2\}.
\]

  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Chains and cochains}\label{sec:chains}

A \textit{$k$-chain} on a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$
is a set of real values associated with every $k$-simplex in $\mathcal{K}$.
Denoting the set of all $k$-simplices in $\mathcal{K}$ by $\mathcal{K}^k$
and its cardinality by $|\mathcal{K}^k|$,
a natural represenation for a chain is a $|\mathcal{K}^k|$-dimensional vector.
The space of all $k$-chains $\mathcal{C}_k$ is a vector space,
and the set of all $k$-simplices can be thought of as its basis.

Whereas a chain is analogous to a vector,
a \textit{cochain} is analogous to a differential form:
a linear function that takes a chain and ''measures'' it,
producing a real number.
A $k$-cochain $\omega^k$ has one linear operation for each $k$-simplex in $\mathcal{K}$,
matching the dimension of the corresponding $k$-chain $c_k$,
and the evaluation $\omega^k(c_k)$ behaves like an inner product between vectors.
Thus, a natural way to represent a cochain is a $|\mathcal{K}^k|$-dimensional \textit{row vector}.

This analogy with differential forms will be useful
when we define discrete forms in the next section.


\section{Discrete differential forms}

Equipped with an oriented simplicial complex,
we can begin to map differential forms and their operations onto it.
This section is based on \parencite{desbrun_discrete_2006},
\parencite{crane_digital_2013}, and \parencite{blair_perot_differential_2014}.


\subsection{Definition of discrete forms}\label{sec:discrete_forms}

Recalling that differential forms can be integrated
over manifolds of matching dimension,
a natural way to map a continuous form to a discrete value on a simplex
is to integrate the form over that simplex.
In other words, given a differential $k$-form $\omega^k$
and $k$-simplex $\sigma_k$, we can get a scalar value $\widehat{\omega}^k$
associated with $\sigma_k$ by computing the integral

\[
  \widehat{\omega}^k = \int_{\sigma_k} \omega^k.
\]

This is a line integral over a line segment for 1-forms,
surface integral over a triangle for 2-forms,
volume integral over a tetrahedron for 3-forms, and so on.
Additionally, a 0-form (i.e. a scalar field)
integrated over a 0-simplex (i.e. a single point)
is the value of the form at that point.

Computing this integral for every $k$-simplex in a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$
produces a set of values associated with the $k$-simplices,
which can be interpreted as a chain or cochain.
Due to the analogous nature of differential forms and cochains
covered in section \ref{sec:chains},
the most fitting choice of interpretation here is a cochain.
This leads us to the following definition:

A discrete differential $k$-form on an oriented simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$
is a $k$-cochain obtained by integrating a continuous $k$-form
over every $k$-simplex in $\mathcal{K}$.

A consequence of defining discrete forms as a single real value per simplex
is that vector-valued forms (1-forms and 2-forms in 3D)
lose information about their direction.
A line integral only records the component of the form tangential to the line,
discarding the orthogonal component,
and a surface integral is only affected by flux across the surface.
However, directions are not actually needed in most DEC computations.
If one is desired (e.g. for visualization),
it can be reconstructed from multiple nearby simplices via \textit{interpolation},
which will be covered in section \ref{sec:interpolation}.

TODO: that last paragraph is maybe a bit confusing,
can I word it better or move it somewhere else?
Could be best to just say this in the interpolation section
without alluding to it beforehand

The discrete equivalent of a differential form being a cochain,
the discrete versions of the operations of exterior calculus
are operations on cochains.

\subsection{Discrete exterior derivative}\label{sec:disc_ext_der}

Section \ref{sec:ext_der} briefly introduced Stokes' theorem
(equation \ref{eq:stokes_theorem}).
In the domain of a $k$-simplex $\sigma$, it states that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stokes_simplex}
  \int_{\sigma} \mathbf{d}\alpha = \int_{\partial\sigma} \alpha,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a $(k-1)$-form.

Writing this in terms of the exterior derivative's
vector analogues covered in section \ref{sec:ext_der}
($\nabla$, $\nabla \times$, and $\nabla \cdot$)
yields several well-known vector calculus identities.

When $k = 1$, equation \ref{eq:stokes_simplex}
is the fundamental theorem of calculus
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fund_theorem_calc}
  \int_{\sigma} \nabla \alpha = \alpha(v_2) - \alpha(v_1)
\end{equation}
where $v_1,v_2$ are the endpoints of the line segment $\sigma$.

When $k = 2$, we get the curl theorem
\begin{equation}\label{eq:curl_theorem}
  \iint_{\sigma} (\nabla \times \alpha) \cdot dA = \int_{\partial\sigma} \alpha \cdot dl,
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to Green's theorem in two-dimensional space.

Finally, when $k = 3$, we get the divergence theorem
\begin{equation}\label{eq:divergence_theorem}
  \iiint_{\sigma} (\nabla \cdot \alpha) \,dV = \iint_{\partial\sigma} \alpha \,dA.
\end{equation}

Stokes' theorem expresses and generalizes the common property between these identities,
that an integral over a $k$-dimensional volume
can be turned into an integral over the volume's boundary and vice versa.
It is a powerful theorem with many applications.
For the use case of discrete exterior calculus,
it can be used as the \textit{definition} of
the discrete exterior derivative.
More specifically, we can define the discrete exterior derivative
as the unique operator $\mathbf{d}$ satisfying equation \ref{eq:stokes_simplex}.

To make this concrete, first note that the integrals here
are exactly how cochain elements were defined in section \ref{sec:discrete_forms}.
$\int_{\sigma} \mathbf{d}\alpha$ is an element of a $k$-cochain,
and $\int_{\partial\sigma} \alpha$ is the sum of all $(k-1)$-cochain elements
constituting the boundary of $\sigma$.
In a sense, $\mathbf{d}$ does the opposite of the boundary operator $\partial$
defined in section \ref{sec:discrete_forms}:
whereas $\partial$ takes a simplex and produces the sum of its faces,
$\mathbf{d}$ takes the sum of a simplex's faces and produces the simplex itself.
In more precise terms, $\mathbf{d}$ is the \textit{adjoint} of $\partial$,
also known as the \textit{coboundary operator}.

Given a simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$,
$\mathbf{d}$ is a linear map from $\mathcal{K}^{k-1}$ to $\mathcal{K}^k$.
Hence, it can be represented as a $|\mathcal{K}^k| \times |\mathcal{K}^{k-1}|$ matrix.
Each row of this matrix corresponds to one $k$-simplex
and represents a signed sum of its faces taking into account relative orientation.
Each column corresponding to a boundary simplex has a coefficient
of 1 or -1 depending on orientation,
and the rest of the coefficients are zeroes.
Graph theorists call this type of matrix an \textit{adjacency matrix}.

A remarkable property of a discrete exterior derivative
defined this way is that it is \textit{exact}.
The value obtained by integrating a form over boundary simplices
and taking the discrete exterior derivative
is exactly the value one would obtain
by first taking the continuous exterior derivative of the same form
and integrating it over the bounded volume.
As a result, use of the discrete exterior derivative in a numerical method
introduces no additional error.
This simplifies the analysis of a method's accuracy
by eliminating one source of error.

TODO: a visual example would be nice here

TODO: unify notation: pick either $\alpha$ or $\omega$
and use it for all forms and cochains,
and either use or don't use dimension indices
